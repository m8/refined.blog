# contribution guideline

- Please do not add company blogs.
- The number of tags should not exceed 15.
- Please do not add `hnp` entry for blogs. I will recalculate and update each week.

**Example:**
```

    "name": "Drew DeVault's blog",
    "url": "https://drewdevault.com",
    "tags": [
        "software",

    ],
